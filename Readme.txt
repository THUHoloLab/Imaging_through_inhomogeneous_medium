Noise suppression is one of the most important tasks in imaging through inhomogeneous mediums. Here, we proposed a denoising approach based on compressive in-line holography for imaging through an inhomogeneous medium. A reference-beam-free system with a low-cost continuous-wave laser is presented. The suppression against the noise, which is brought by the scattering photons, is presented in simulations using the proposed algorithm. The noise immunity is demonstrated in lensless imaging behind a random phase mask with an optical depth of 1.42 by single exposure, as well as behind a ground glass with an optical depth of 6.38 by multiple exposures.
